# SharePlace

#Technical Stacks: React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, JavaScript, CSS( MERN Stack)

#Purpose of Application:

It is a web application that allows users to share places they want along with google maps facility to other users.

Here front-end is designed using React.js, JavaScript, CSS

While, back-end is developed using Node.js, Express.js and data is stored using MongoDB Atlas


#How to use this code in your system.

First of all simply download this code in your computer/laptop.

Then, install all dependencies using npm install in each of front-end and back-end folder using CLI

Once you install all dependencies, replace the API_Key( I have commented in code where to change this API_Key) with the actual value of your google api key in order to use to map facility provided by Google. 

Additionally, also replace mongoDB url in the app.js file of back-end folder in order to connect to your own back-end MongoDB database.

Once you did all the above step, you application will start working.
